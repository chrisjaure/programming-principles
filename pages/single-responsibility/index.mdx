# Single Responsibility

This principle can be summarized as:

> A component should have only one reason to change.

</Callout>

Let's explore when you should follow this principle, and the trade-offs when you do.

## Example

To make it easier to talk about abstract concepts, we will start by outlining a concrete problem to solve:

1. Collect a city name from the user.
2. When the user submits the form, fetch weather data for the city.
3. When the result is received, display it.

Here's a demo:

import { App } from "./preview";

<CH.Preview id="sr-preview">

<App />

</CH.Preview>

## One Component

Below is a single component that meets all of the requirements.

```jsx App.jsx
// from ./preview.jsx 4:35
```

### This approach is good when

- you're building a proof of concept
- you are learning
- the requirements won't change over time
- you have a tight deadline

In fact, most code starts out this way because it's easy to write and understand!
Later on, it may be refactored using the single responsibility principle.
The next section shows what that refactor might look like.

## Multiple Components

Here is an architecture that also meets the requirements.
We have one component (`App`) that composes the smaller
pieces into a working app. The form, the weather display, and the data fetching
are all broken up into smaller pieces that are responsible for their own part.

```jsx App.jsx
// from ./refactor/App.jsx
```

```jsx CityForm.jsx
// from ./refactor/CityForm.jsx
```

```jsx WeatherResult.jsx
// from ./refactor/WeatherResult.jsx
```

```js api.js
// from ./refactor/api.js 3:6
```

### This approach is good when

- the requirements will change over time
- you want to write tests for individual pieces
- you want to reuse parts of the code
- you have a decent idea how to structure the code

### New problems

It's important to note the trade-offs we're making with this approach.
Tracing the flow of data through the app is now more difficult! We've got
a couple new problems to work through:

1. passing data down from parent to child
2. passing data up from child to parent

Now we need to know how to use props for #1 and callbacks for #2. This overhead
was not present in the single component approach. Without something like Typescript
to help give structure to data, tracing the flow of data through your app can become
difficult.
